# EmotiText-AI-Powered-Text-Emotion-Detector
A small project I built for fun using NLP and deep learning — it detects emotions (like joy, anger, sadness) from raw text input.

# EmotiText — AI-Powered Text Emotion Detector 

This is a small project I created for fun — it uses **Natural Language Processing** and a pre-trained deep learning model to **detect emotions from plain text**.

Whether it's a happy message, an angry rant, or something sad — EmotiText tries to guess the emotion behind it. ⚡

## What it does

You type any sentence, and the model predicts the emotion:
- 😄 Joy
- 😠 Anger
- 😢 Sadness
- 😨 Fear
- 😐 Neutral
- ❤️ Love (sometimes!)

## Tech Used

- Python 
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NLP preprocessing
- A pre-trained emotion classification model (from Kaggle or HuggingFace)
